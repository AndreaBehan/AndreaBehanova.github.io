    info:
      - degree: PhD in Computerized Image Processing
        university: Uppsala University
        time: Sep 2020 - Present
        details: |
          Our overall objective is to develop an analysis and visualization 
          platform that combines genetic profiling data with quantitative 
          measurements of histological morphology. We will thus create a scalable, 
          multi-layered visual representation of clinically relevant information in 
          a morphological context. By providing spatial distributions of molecular 
          profiles these can be correlated to morphological features providing new 
          powerful information tools for understanding tumor heterogeneity and 
          interactions with the tumor micro-environment. This particular PhD project 
          will start to focus on understanding the spatial distribution of mRNA and 
          cells working with graph-based methods.
      - degree: MSc in Medical Physics
        university: University of Eastern Finland
        time: Sep 2018 - May 2020
        details: |
          Master's Degree Programme in Medical Physics is a multidisciplinary 
          two-year master's degree programme that combines high-level research 
          and teaching. The programme is designed for all nationalities, and a 
          maximum of 15 students will be accepted into it.
          In the programme, curriculum theory meets practice: The programme 
          includes the possibility for a clinical internship at the Kuopio 
          University Hospital, consisting of e.g. quality assurance measurements, 
          training in radiation dosage planning for cancer treatment and getting 
          familiar with the routine tasks of a medical physicist. The clinical 
          internship can be replaced with a research internship at one of the 
          high-class research groups at the Department of Technical Physics at 
          the University of Eastern Finland. The master’s programme will equip 
          the student with specialist skills in the field of medical physics. 
          In addition, the course of study will provide the expertise required 
          to pursue a specialization as a medical physicist and can open pathways 
          to further advanced studies and fellowship opportunities. Upon completion 
          of the programme, the graduate will have a career path tailored to his 
          or her needs or interests, creating a possibility of:
            - Continuing advanced studies to pursue a career as a scientist
            - Becoming a valuable part of industry (e.g., in health technology and engineering)
            - Working in management and teaching
            - Acting in science administration at national level or internationally
            - Continuing in pursuit of a career as a specialized medical physicist
      - degree: BSc in Biomedical Technology and Bioinformatics
        university: Brno University of Technology
        time: Sep 2014 - Jun 2017
        details: |
          The aim of the study program Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics 
          is to educate practically oriented graduates, but also future students 
          of follow-up master's courses at universities focused on the fields of 
          biomedical engineering, medical informatics, bioinformatics and mathematical 
          biology. The graduate will be equipped with theoretical knowledge of 
          mathematics, physics and chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology and 
          pathophysiology of man, which are needed to understand the basic biological 
          processes in the human body, general and professional language skills, 
          as well as skills for communication with doctors and other medical staff. 
          The graduate will master the principles of activity and the principles 
          of using the means of medical technology and biomedical informatics, 
          will be able to programmatically communicate with these means; will 
          have an overview of current information in the field of legislation, 
          which will be able to apply appropriately in practice. Emphasis is also 
          placed on general and professional language training.
